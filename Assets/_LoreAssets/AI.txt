Patrol
Alert others
Start chasing while shooting at the player and right where he is going
If player not in line of sight, compute quadratic function to get to last player position through ML or NavMesh
Move randomly to dodge while shooting when close enough
If player hasn't been seen in 20 seconds, wide rotation around where player disappeared for 20 seconds then go back to patrol

Drone
-----
Reach position above player, lower altitude to shoot
If reaching position meets obstacle â†’ polynomial regression to dodge
Afetr seeing, remembers position even if sight lost
To get sight, send raycast to player and check collision and normal within a certain angle range (vision only in front)
