1: Use inverse kinematics to control leg
2: Fix bottom of the leg to the ground
3: Make a target point attached to the body
4: Raycast from the target point downwards to move it up and down
5: Check distance from target point
6: Move leg towards target when distance gets too big
7: Put legs in a zigzag pattern
8: Only move leg when opposite legs are grounded (same clip)
9: Use average leg position + offset for the body position
10: Rotate body based on difference between left and right leg height
