Idea
----
Have 2 main vehicles: a rover and a speeder between which we can choose in every garage (tent with tools)
Each has a main bloc with propulsion, weapons and upgrades missing (guided missiles, shield module, ...)
The main bloc has 4 propulsion spots and 2 or 3 spots for weapons and upgrades
→ The player has to choose the most efficient combination of tools according to its needs, the number of spots can
  get higher when we unlock new ones: add some form of spot to the vehicle

Needed

Reuse:
